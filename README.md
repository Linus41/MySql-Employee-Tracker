# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

For this project I created a CLI application that allows a user to create, view, and manage employees, departments, and roles. 

This application meets the MVP; it is a functional application that adds departments, roles, and employees. It allows the user to view these three categories, and employee roles may be updated by the user.
